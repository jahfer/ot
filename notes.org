* General
** Ideas for multiple cursors
*** Store as metadata
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     (def operation ^{::cursor {:position 4 :name "Jahfer"}}
       {:ops [] :client-id "client-a9d9h-a3" :parent-id 4 :id 5})
   #+END_SRC
*** Store as operation (is transient, so may not make sense)
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (->Op :cursor {:position 4 :name "Jahfer"})
#+END_SRC
*** Pass as completely separate feed (seems weird b/c dependent on positions)

** How to Render
*** Use react-style components for all nodes, and track edits within and between!
  - Text changes happen in a =<OTText>= element, images are =<OTImage>=, cursors are potentially a separate layer on top?
#+BEGIN_SRC xml
  <Document>
    <OTText>Hello World. </OTText><OTLink href="http://google.com">Click me!</OTLink>
    <OTImage src="http://google.com/image.png">
  </Document>
#+END_SRC
*** Parse to data structure, render however you want!
  - Keep data structure around to apply operations onto? Sounds tricky, but necessary
  - The key is to represent your document as data!!!!

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [{:node-type :text :length 7 :data "Hello, "}
   {:node-type :link :length 6 :data {:href "http://jahfer.com"
                                      :text "Jahfer"
                                      :alt "Jahfer Husain's Portfolio"}}
   {:node-type :text :length 1 :data "!"}]
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Hello, Jahfer!"
#+END_QUOTE

*** Good idea: B+ Tree for applying operations on data structure.

     That way we can skip large chunks of the document to apply operations to the correct area.
